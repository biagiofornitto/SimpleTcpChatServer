# Simple Chat Server

> Write a very simple chat server that should listen on TCP port 10000 for clients. The chat protocol is very simple, clients connect with "telnet" and write single lines of text. On each new line of text, the server will broadcast that line to all other connected clients.


## Test

 1) Open a terminal and Run the server.py
 2) Open a new terminal and run client.py as many times as you want
 3) Insert a username for every running client
 4) Send your messages and enjoy!
